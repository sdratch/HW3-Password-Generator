This project is to generate a passcode given a certain criteria prompted by the messages.

Clicking the button will pormpt the user for a certain length between 8 and 128, and whether the user would like to have either lowercase, uppercase, special characters, or numbers in the password.

The program will then create a random password with all the characters specified at the given length.
